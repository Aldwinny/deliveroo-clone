## This is a project based on a [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkEnidfZnCU)

I'm only uploading this to Github so I can easily access this on other devices. Might remove when I'm done with the tutorial.

Node is v16.19.0, a downgrade because Expo apparently doesn't support 17 and up. So nvm is used on host machine to manage node/npm version.
